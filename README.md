# UnrealEngine--ProjectilePathDisplay

A blueprint module for visualizing projectile trajectory in Unreal Engine. Optimized for Unreal Engine 5 Early Access.

**Preview:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5c7tiTaXYk

## Notes:
- The BP_ProjectilePathDisplay actor contains the core logic for visualizing the projectile trajectories. Add it as a child actor to your weapons and call the Activate/Deactivate Module events to control the path display system.
- The predicted projectile paths are visualized through instanced static meshes while decals are used to visualize the impact location.
